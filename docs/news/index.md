# Changelog

## glmtlp 2.0.3

- Add the missing `<algorithm>` include to the C++ sources that call
  `std::fill` and `std::copy`. These previously compiled only because
  libc++ pulled the header in transitively; libc++ 23 removed those
  transitive includes, which broke compilation under clang 23.
- Drop the unused `<iostream>` include from four sources.
